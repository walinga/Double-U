DOUBLE-U

Language Specification, version 1

=================================

Double-u is a command-based language. Code is interpreted rather than compiled,
meaning that an error will not cause the code preceding it to fail.

The main data structure of Double-u is the array, which can be specified as for
example, `[ 1 2 4 ]`. The various built-in functions are able to manipulate 
arrays to produce interesting results.

Built-in functions:
`let [name] = [value]` - assigns value to name, where value can be an array or int
`print [name]` - outputs the value of name to standard out
`merge [name1] [name1]` - combines the values of name1 and name2 into a new array
`[fn]! [arr]` - calls the list function fn with arr as the parameter

See test.doubleu for concrete examples of these functions and their uses.
